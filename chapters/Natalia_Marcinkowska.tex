  \underline{Squidward Q. Tentacles} is a fictional character voiced by actor Rodger \\ 
Bumpass in the Nickelodeon animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. 
Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared on television in the series' pilot episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999. \\
\textbf{Although his name has the word "squid" in it and he has only six tentacles}, Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus.He lives in a moai between SpongeBob SquarePants' and Patrick Star's houses. The character is portrayed as short-tempered, impatient, arrogant, sassy, introverted, condescending, bitter, and misanthropic, and he hates his two neighbors' constant disruptive antics. However, the pair are unaware of Squidward's dislike towards them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant, a job which he does not enjoy. \\
