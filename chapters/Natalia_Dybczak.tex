\textit{\textbf{The Poppy War} is a 2018 novel by R. F. Kuang, published by Harper Voyager. The Poppy War, a grimdark fantasy, draws its plot and politics from mid-20th-century China, with the conflict in the novel based on the Second Sino-Japanese War, and an atmosphere inspired by the Song dynasty. A sequel, \textbf{The Dragon Republic}, was released in August 2019, and a third book, \textbf{The Burning God} was released November 2020.}

\textit{The Poppy} War is the story of passionate yet ruthless Fang Runin, also known as Rin, who grows up poor, orphaned by a previous war. But she studies and gets into an elite military academy, and develops a gift for shamanism that lets her call upon the fire powers of a vengeful Phoenix god. She wins a war, and joins a civil war for a new republic â€” only to face enemies from her own country, a former invader, and a colonial power with guns, airships, and other superior technology. \underline{The last book in the trilogy, \textit{The Burning God}, has already been released.} \\

Table~\ref{tab:trilogy_ratings} shows the percentage of stars that each book in The Poppy War Trilogy received.
